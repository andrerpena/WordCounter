What is Bridgewater?

Bridgewater is a community of people who are driven to achieve excellence in their work and their relationships through radical truth and radical transparency. To do this, we strive to understand how reality works so that we can interact with it in effective ways. We are most interested in understanding how the economy, markets, and people work — and in testing our knowledge through the results that we produce.

For nearly 40 years, we have produced a unique track record of performance that is the result of having great people operating in our unique culture. Since our future depends on continuing to attract great people, we have created this experience to introduce you to our approach.
